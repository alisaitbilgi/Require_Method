# Require_Method
In this project I've implemented a require method in order to load local javascript files synchronously, by using XMLHttpRequest object, and making the third parameter "false" . If you want your files to be loaded asynchronously, just change the third parameter as "true".
To use this, just download the repo and then write npm install on terminal..
