# Browser-working version of the "Common JS"

    In this project I've implemented a require method in order to load local javascript files "synchronously" on browser, by using XMLHttpRequest object and no eval! by making the third parameter "false". If you want your files to be loaded asynchronously, just change the third parameter as "true".
To use this, just download the repo and then type npm install on terminal..
